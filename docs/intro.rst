PriVoice is a full featured, privacy respecting, open source voice assistant.

+ Runs locally with no network connection required.
+ Privacy respecting, secure operation. No data leaves your system.
+ NLP (Noun/Verb) Intent Matching.
+ Unrestricted use of user contributed skills.
+ Unlimited skill stackability. Hyper-link based VUI.

Current constraints on quality STT like poor echo cancellation, CPU processing power, GPU/TPUs (or lack thereof) and RAM (not enough) will eventually disappear at which point a fully functional, completely local privacy respecting framework will become the norm. PriVoice is not designed for inferior hardware and if you run it on low end systems you will most likely be disappointed. That being said, most laptops or desktops with a headset or decent mic/speaker combination can run PriVoice with no issues.

PriVoice was created to address the limitations inherrent in most existing voice frameworks. Issues arising from skill interractions, channel focus, out of band recognition, barge-in and skill isolation are of no concern to the PriVoice skill developer. The skill developer is free to assume this all just works as it is supposed to and is free to concentrate on whatever the skill is supposed to do.
