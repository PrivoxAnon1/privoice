Whats this?

The system volume skill needs to know how to set and get the mic and volume levels. 

These files provide that capability. 

Note only the linux.py file is working. the other 2 are left for historical purposes only.
To add a new platform copy and modify the linux.py file then manually add it as an option in the
volume skill constructor (the only place it is currently used) and edit the yava.yml file to
use your new value (like 'l', 'u', 'p', etc.)

This is the current code from the volume skill which shows what it actually does.

# workaround until we fix the config file to hold the actual module name
cfg_platform = cfg.get_cfg_val('Advanced.Platform')

if cfg_platform == 'u':
    from framework.hal.executables.ubuntu import Platform
elif cfg_platform == 'p':
    from framework.hal.executables.pios import Platform
elif cfg_platform == 'l':
    from framework.hal.executables.linux import Platform

self.hal = Platform(master_control_name, input_device_name, input_level_control_name, output_device_name, output_level_control_name)
