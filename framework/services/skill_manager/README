There are several ways to install your own skill.

First, you can create a pull request and then your skill will be available from the Privox approved skills repo.

Second, you can create your own repository somewhere and edit the repositories.json file (framework/services/skill_manager/repositories.json) and ad your repository URI there. 

Finally, you can install your skill from the local file system. To do this, add an entry to the framework/services/skill_manager/repositories.json file like this ...

        {
            "repo_name":"My Local Skills",
            "repo_uri":"/home/joeblow/my_skills/",
            "repo_description":"My local skills",
        },

In this case the directory /home/joeblow/my_skills/ should look like this ...

privoice_skill_name/
	__init__.py
	skill.json

privoice_skill2_name/
	__init__.py
	skill.json

Which offers two skills, skill_name and skill2_name.

The skill.json files should look like this ...

{
        "skill_id":"my_skillid",
        "name":"My skill",
        "description":"Whatever",
        "search_terms":["me", "myself", "i"]
}

if you have any special requirements you should add a requirements.txt file. 

When your skill is installed it will have its own cirtual environment created for it.
Your requirements will be added to the default which includes just enough to connect to the system message bus.

























Skill Manager Skill
Has a JSON file of repos
for each repo there is a JSON file
    search terms (time, date, default)
    id (must be unique like pva_time or pva_date)
    name (privox default date time skill or joe's joke skill)
    description ''
    repo URL for git clone
    
Is responsible for installing, removing, starting and stopping skills
This means a skill has a started and stopped state which can be
externally controlled. This amounts to kill/stop.sh and ./start.sh
and git clone and rm -Rf /xxx

By default, any skills in the user skills subdirectory are considered
installed and are started by the skill manager at startup.

Active skills should be a ps auxww handler
Installed is the subdirectories under skills/user-skills/
Available is the skill manager JSON file


No skills except skill manager exist initially.
This skill can install, remove, start, stop, skills from the skill repository which is initially a hard coded JSON file. This is a list of skill marketplace objects which include name, url, etc.
